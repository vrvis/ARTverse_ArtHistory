# ARTverse_ArtHistory
The ARTverse project explores solutions for creating, teaching, and exhibiting art in virtual reality. In this git repository you will find a selection of tools to build a VRChat world for teaching art history. The concept of the space is based on the traditional mnemonics technique of spaces of memory.
