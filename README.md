# ARTverse_ArtHistory
The ARTverse project explores solutions for creating, teaching, and exhibiting art in virtual reality. In this git repository you will find a selection of tools to build a VRChat world for teaching art history. The concept of the space is based on the traditional mnemonics technique of spaces of memory. 


ARTverse is a project developed by VRVis GmbH in partnership with the Science Visualization Lab, from the University of Applied Arts Vienna.
The Art History teaching environemnt was developed in collaboration with the art historian and researcher Temenuzhka Dimova from the Laboratory for Cognitive Research in Art History (CReA) from the University of Vienna. 

ARTverse is funded by the netidee promotion campaign from the Internet Stiftung â€“ Austria.
